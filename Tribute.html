    <h1 style="color: orangered;">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj - The Lion</h1>
    <p>The lion is the king of the jungle. 
        There are other animals too. But, the lion is the king because it knows its strengths. 
        If you irk it, you will risk your life. 
        The lion is courageous and guards its herd with all its might. 
        The simple presence of the lion is enough to scare its enemies. 
        Its simple roar is enough to scare the other people.</p>
        <p style="color: red;">So, was our brave Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</p>

        <p>Shivaji Bhonsale I (Marathi pronunciation: [ʃiʋaˑɟiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 1627 / 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]), also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati (emperor) of his realm at Raigad.</p>
        <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda and the Sultanate of Bijapur, as well as with European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi language.</p>
